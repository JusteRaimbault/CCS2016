## Keynote - Sonia Kefi - Multiplexity ecological networks

Why species coexist ?

competitive exclusion principle. : back to Gause, 1932. but many communities violate this principle. : cf Plancton.

Paradox of the plankton. : how do species reach comunity forms ?

deviation from random web contribute to stability.

need of combining different types of interaction -> multiplex ecological networks.

[Kefi et al, 2012, Ecol Letters]

[Mougi and Kondoh, 2008 Science] : introduction of mutualistic links. optimal trade-off ?

[Kefi et al 2015] : extensive interactions.

do species collapse in smaller sets of multiplex clusters ?

**Unsupervised** detection of communities in multiplex networks [Miele at al., 2014] - stochastic block modeling type approach

[Kefi et al. 2016, PlosBiol] -> clusters. why does matter to ecology ?

(...)

need of larger, systematic, different datasets.

back to May : structural regularities contribute to stability ; only recently : multiplex.

Q : only topological ?

Q : evolutionary implications ?
