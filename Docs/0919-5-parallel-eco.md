## Parallel Session - Cognition and Economics

### Role of NRF Fellows

pertinence of research networks ? - collaboration networks


### Coevolutionary approach to sustainibility transitions

closing feedbacl loop

Fast and Frugal heuristics

social learning and opinion dynamics

ressource depletion still globally and structurally stable.

change transient dynamics through initial campaign size.

cl :
  - new way to link decision making and opinion dynamics
  - grounded on psycho research.

### Inference of phylogenetic structure inspired from ecological networks

techno dev // ecologic radiations

bipartite view : countries <-> products // species<-> islands

[Tacchella, Di Clemente, Gabrielli, Pietronero, arxiv 2016] - how useful given ingredients.
power law.

interaction matrix -> bipartite -> projection -> filtration


### Heterogeneous agent model of transition towards a circular economy

linear economy model : take-make-dispose
value created by looping products

Focus : behavioral constraints and market drivers/barriers

example : recycling of tyres.

heterogeneous agent model : not fully rationnal, heuristic rules for agent decisions.

not high value recycling

Model : circular and non-circular production
techno diffusion diminishes cost (quadratic cost)

Evolutionary switching [Brock and Hommes, Econometrica 97]

DC model for choice, asynchronous updating.

bifurcation analysis.

Circularity indicators computation.

Q : other type of utilities ?
environmental influen.

Q : space. Percolation model to check sensitivity. // network structure influence.


### Evolving network model for structure of visitors and services

representation of Lodging-Service nw : abstract nw reproduce geographical positions -> role of space !

good agreement simulation <-> analytical.
cl : more destinations ; distance.
