### The Reasonable Effectiveness of Roles in Networks

network as an ecosystem -> function of nodes ?

nodes have mixture of roles.

role â‰  from communities and/or positions. sense of roles ?

Recursive feature extraction : [Henderson at al, KDD 2011]
neighborhood features : connectivity patterns ; recursive : how neighbors are.

then extraction of node : [Henderson et al., KDD 2012]

use of non-negative matrix factorization to group features.

 -> non-supervised.

roles : bridges, periphery etc. expressed in terms of initial features.

Mapping Big Data

Complementary with community detection : use role to delete some not wanted nodes.
**!! -> check possibilities on patent data ?**

Role transfer : role discovery with supervised learning.
 -> better train-test prediction accuracy in role space than initial features.
: able to train on classes that are similar, generally

Second generation : [Gilpin et al, KDD 2013]
[Rossi et al, WSDM 2013]
[Gilpin et al, arxiv 2016] multi-relational roles
-> time-evolving network.

: good way to link "pyhiscs of nws" and mining

Q : non connected ?

Q : higher dimensions ? tensors.

Q : evolution of roles in time ? difficulty in discretizing.


## Ignites

### Entropy prod master eq systems

Mapping Master eqs systems with eletrical circuits.

### Intestinal worm

-- bayesian fitting

### Early warning - whales ecosystem

socio-ecosyst : whale watching.

### Problems of Louvain algo

arbitrarily badly connected.

-> Leiden algo, better

### Complexity economics as a paradigm

fail of neoclassical (mainstream)

Complexity economics : evolving cs, open-ended process.

modifs of scientificity criteria : accept simulation as a theoretization tool

### Modelling Regulatory Methods for RTS

-> equal headway config not stable.

ant algo for self-organazing transportation.
