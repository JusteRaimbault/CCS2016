## Paul Bourgine - presentation

CS-DC : TIMES flagship

Context : anthropocene -> unequally affected territories ; for any natural ressources.
: Multi-level equity and sustainibility.

Objective : Same equality of chance to design :
  * at each level, smartest open roadmap
  * open responsinble innovation
  * smartest predictions
  * smartest prof path

  cf UN 2030 sustainibility agenda.

### What is smartest ?

  existing : UN SEEA -> Extended Environmental Input/Output Matrices
but missing : social objectives. aggregated matrix : need to be working at basic level.

### How to do that ?

#### 1) Governance

Smog ecosystem : Scalable Multilevel Open Governance
 -> Open Government Partnership

Thesis : Smog roadmaps are fulfilling

Equi-adaptation paradigm : fitness landscape given by $dx_i/dt = x_i*fitness + diffusion$.
co-evolution has attractor at 0 : equi-adapt. [Feistel and Ebeling, 82]
 1- species coevole in mean at level zero
 2- increase mean fitness prop to covariance (Fisher law)
 3- red queen law
 4- ?

Anthropocene : Universal Interdependence

coevolutionary processes : less continuous, turbulent and edge of chaos.

network of int : mutual support and equiadapt ; tolerant and and suppressive zone
-> true for responsible innovations : most successful territories never missed scientific and technological revolution.

#### 2) Innovation

Worlwide Open Responsible innovations
Living Open Roadmaps <-> NBICS revolution through WORI market

2nd internet rev : immutable trustable data respecting privacy : blockchain and cryptography ; etc Interplanetary File System
New sharing economy.

#### 3) predictions

Best predictions: Worldwide Open Probabilistic Prediction Ecosystem.

Big data and Dynamic Deep Learning.

certified best model through olympiads of open models.

#### 4) Lifelong personalized Learning

Smarter and smarter territories at every level.
Smart Rwanda : towards its Knowledge Economy.

### CL

Knowledge economy can link circular economy and

----

Q :
Paris Summit : Open Government, all society actors.
10 rounds tables, proposed by countries.
5-10 dec. 2016

Q Denise : driving forces ?
  -> coevolution. cf mutualism in ecosystems. also driving force in scientific community, relation with rest of the world.
  make every trustable ; without bureaucraty : smart adaptive contracts. sufficient ?



## Sander Van der Leeuw (SFI) - TIMES - The Global Systems Context

tipping point, crisis ?
global socio-env context develops at exponential rate.

some of planetary bounds already crossed.
different boundaries will interact : destabilization of the system.

population increase ; increase in global life expectancy.

Spatial distribution of food insecurity.

recent spike in food prices.

// Peak in oil production.

decrease in return on invested capital in US. Similar tendancy to decline in entrepreneurship.

number of patents per inventor decreased when size of teams increase : innovate is more and more dififcult.

income invested in speculation > invested in innovation ! idems loans to productive economy vs finance.

increasing urbanisation : issue with allometric factors.

 * all one emerging crisis. : everything interacts.
 due to unintended consequences of earlier actions ?
 -> need to review and adapt our 'value space' :
  - Learn from the past about present for future.
  - Explain stability : why and how stability ; maintain it ?
  - Design for change


Education is our principal tool :
  * Intellectual dvlpmt vs socialization
  * educate in terms of alternatives from the start : choices have consequences ; unintended consequences
  * teach and develop local ideas and values
    : value space (western) is saturated : create an inverted economy.

Q : expand on inverted economy ? value def drives all aspects of economy. our eco : created value in its center, aim at getting rich in the center. inversion : create value outside the center, inverse flows.

Q Paul : include all pbs : requires an incredible level of innovation ?
pb with western system. reconstitute a higher level of orga, bound now to decentralize. cities more important : remain coherent, against fragmentation of nation state.
pb of city and country side, experiments in China.


## Denise - Considering Urban Geo-diversity in global models of ecological transition

GeoDiverCity : modelling geo diversity of cities and system of cities.
  * stylized facts : diversified, hierarchized and diffused techno
  * find generic dynamics by simulation
  * ?

Lot of cultural difference in inhabiting.
ex [Bertaud 2005] : density for 49 metropolitan areas.

**IDEA : systematic morpho analysis (not only density) and with nw ? (as Florent for Europe)**

-> political, techno, ecological etc consequences.
Path-dependency : cf Atlanta vs Barcelona

recall : Urban systems organisational emergent properties.
two levels.
define city ? 1hour commuting.
micro <-> meso (city) <-> system of cities.

interaction accross the levels.

Urban systems as socio-environmental adaptors/creators.

meso : 1hour ; macro : 1day. emergent properties : hierarchy of size, scaling laws, functional/cultural geodiversity.
increase in travel speed.

### simulation models :

Simpop 96, Simpop2 2006
Simpoplocal, Marius 2014 etc.

**IDEA : recode, retest, explore first simpop models ?**

3 stages : agrarian economy (SimpopLocal) [Urban transition] => Market economy, network returns (SimpopNet) [Environmental transition] => knowledge economy (SimpopClim)

understand the co-evolution in cities.

Need for an other generation of simpopmodel, including constraints.

Optimistic : system of cities already organized to share info/ressources. System open to disseminate inventions.

Urban trajectories to reconstruct.

Incremental method of Marius. (dimensions : interactions agents/env ; agents/agents ; versions of mechanisms)
*Q : why these dimensions exactly ? more generic formulation ?...*

cf fit of Marius2 *Q : what about overfitting ?*

openmole, exploration **!!Not FULL space**
-> sensitivity profile, more sure about predictions.
Scaling laws.

China : Aublant : ICARE.
Wuhan districts.
policies : bicycle/electric ; use of coal forbidden. top-down policies.
be careful of western vision criticizing : also consider positive aspect. Different ways of thinking *different philosophy, way of seeing things*
high rises also for residence in China.
Cities all comprehensively planned : well defined urban perimeter, relocation of industries.
Railway system : connurbation 30Mio people.
environemntal quality : energy standard requirements.

Q : uneven dvlpmt in China. cities trying to develop own experience : how can China bring their own way of thinking to the world ?
-> how to chain values, integrate.
importance of scientifically literacy of party people. evaluate and avaluated ; directed control.
China invented education and sanction according to merit. works for now.

Q : Paul. globalized cities, long-distance relations. inequality of salaries. good for connexion but more ineq?
-> complementarity from differences ? beware of competition and solidarity.
CHina : upper level of control. to let system of cities, must create governance structure at level of planet. managing global environment. but need strict roles, force of constraint.
financial system in China : regulated.


## Carlo Jaeger - Territorial and functional structures in the face of global systemic risks

Global risks : many challenges of global coordination. (including war)

but also global opportunities. health, education, purchasing power, human flourishing.

can be reach if tackle global coordination challenge.

Elements of global coordination ?
 - Leviathan model : hegemonic nations : Spain, UK, US.
 - World markets
 - oligarchy : !! global oligarchy. capital mobility is enough for dinasties to success.
 - Professional communities : spectacular achievments.

 danger of lossing athenian democraty. danger of 90% fo people who do not know whats going on.
 10 year rule. : to be very good at something , 10years.
 not more than 1/2 big change. von neuman. farmers.

 Cultural evolution :
  * beyond gene-meme trap : even in bio gene only not true : regulatory networks, environment.  -> need adaptive multi-level structures
  * Population games with niche
relate utility with fitness ?
need to integrate what we know about prices.

 * Territory-based rules and nations
 * Function-based rules and pofessions
 -> intersection of this two rules system.

 Property rights and global capital.
 who controls savings. financial institutions that are part of oligarchy system ! nation do not anymore.
 professional can be alternative.

### Local Spaces - Global Connections
   * need for pilot experiences : different scales, different dimensions.
   * Strengthening local synergies : do not try to compete ; local niches of specialization. many dimensions. do not crystalize hierarchies : **decorrelate scaling laws ! Idea : cf territorialization** *all best in sg, poor in sg else*
   * Expanding professional linkages : education, pension systems, creativity.


  Q Denise : how do manage both local specialization and ability to adapt further ?
   -> why we need pilot experiences, document failures.
   London : reinvent and shape niche again.

  Rq Rozenblat : database with interlinked clusters. how to regulate small worlds

  Q : aggrgation mechanisms : how do avoid regional specialists to be absorbed ?
  -> scales. properties. tarnsition in distribution and organisation of wealth.
  Switzerland : smart strategies, focus to move. local community survive in global world. change rules of the game ?
