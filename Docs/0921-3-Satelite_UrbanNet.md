### O. Har-Shemesh - Electric Vehicle Charging as CAS

qualitative changes in cas
snesitivity of proba to small changes in params. (phase diagram sensitivity)

Fisher info to quantify sensitivity
**check that**
ex normal distrib

[ , ?] : phase transition of Ising model
**IDEA: for space matters comparison phase diagrams**

System : charging. constantly changing params.


### Michael et al. - Residential mobility

upward/downward social mobility.

census section inside neighborhoods.
social mobility : change of neigh.

âˆ†quantile after move -> decrease of mobility 2005-2010
top6 up/down : significant.
map it

worse area : strong correlation with unemployment rate.
rich area : stagnate.

Future work : network measures, link with socio-eco vars.
community analysis : geographical split
flows, communities over time.

Rq : segmentation independantly of location.


###  F Simini - Population growth, migration flows and urbanization

Def of urban boundaries ?

Data ? ex WorldPop project, predictions for China.
Fb : 5meters resolution. *rq : what point, knowing where buildings are ?*
data in the past : not good or no data.

Zipf's law

Gibrat -> Zipf

num cities in a country : proportional to population.

Scale invariance of spatial distribution. -> cf Christaller

growth literature : Correlated percolation (makse batty paper)
growing social networks [Phys Review E, 2014]

Model : Simon birth-death + migration (flows)

flows : gravity ; opportunities.

-> deterministic eq.
Equilibrium state, stability : T big leads to city formation.

characteristic distance between cities : wavelength of more instable mode ?

cl : comparison of two mechanisms.
human population dynamics. model spatio-temporal correlations.
 : correlation patterns explained by migration only.

 Rq : Batty : relation pop-num cities : depends definition cities. : polarizes question what is a city ?
-> pattern-oriented modeling. on various defs of cities ?
[Wilson : business distrib]



### B Soudararaj - High Street Sensor

smartstreetsensor

sensor recording passages of users.

MAC anonymisation.

Q : privacy etc.

### ? at Casa - Agglomeration in Retail Activity

model consistent with super-linear scaling of attractiveness with floorspace;

Q : next to large store for medium store ?

### Expenditures - Urban mobility

(...)

### Barthelemy - Fundamental Diagram of urbanization

from data to theory : small-scale data, various sources.

very precise info, urban sprawl.

average pop density. : similar pattern ? **of course and NO**

by districts.

characterizing urbanisation : fixed area A ; population ; number of buildings.

trajectories in time.

*Q def of buildings ?*

-> "fundamental diagram of urbanisation"

decrease in pop : conversion into other usages.

Simple model (CA ?)
corresponding mean-field eq.

-> saturation point over which pop decreases

rescaled quantities : universal behavior ?

[Book october 2016, structure and dynamics of cities]

Q : no economics ?

Q : ?

**rq : administrative boundary, wrong !**

Rq : Batty, London ?

Q :  ?


### Tweets - water leaks

@Piniisima

Q : not answering phone ? twitter as intermediate media to be informed.


### Estimating non-linearity in scaling laws

### Estimating railway demand using social media
