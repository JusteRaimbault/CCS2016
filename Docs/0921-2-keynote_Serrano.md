## Keynote - A Serrano - Hidden Geometry of Complex Networks

topological distance : not metric distance.
-> well behave distance in nw, to do maps ?

distance in an underlying euclidian/spherical space

[Serrano, Krioukov, Boquna] some nw without space ; some spatially embedded nw have other underlying metric space
-> hidden metric space

S1 model -> control degree distrib. gravity-based connections.
reproduce also self-similarity.
degree-thresholding renormalization procedure/ ?

Generalization : H2 einstenian model, purely geometric


[Serrano, Boguna, Sagues, 2012] distance based community detection
