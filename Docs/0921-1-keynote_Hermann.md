## Keynote - Hans Hermann - Epidemics

rem sis model.

Moving particles : [Phys Review E 2006]

Coupled with an economic system : more recovery if money (budget)
[Phys Reports 2015, with Helbing]
Critical cost above which pandemics. discontinuous transition.

Constraint of connection to a supply center
[BÃ¶ttcher, Wooley-Meza, Goles, Helbing, Hermann, PhysRev E 2016]
-> jumps in evolution
*not clear power law, then still in investigation -> wtf ?*
Presence of hysteresis : disconnection of supply center. destroyed by long-range connections.

Metastability : *work in progress*
bifurcation / hysteresis region.
add long range connections to the square lattice -> hysteresis region grows.
small region with oscillations, difficult to find.

cl : interesting extensions of sis model.

Q : everyone infected ?
Q : what type of oscillations ?

SIS model in the brain (for dynamics) : off/on.
SOC where best connectivity.

### Delmans - Modeling complex biological systems

multilevel system.
incompatbility of models between levels. : implementation.
-> abstract fwk (abm) for hierarchical modeling. <Child,Reader,Engine>

Turing patterns : reaction-diffusion. patterns : steady state solution in time, not in space.
reac-diff on nw.

@TahaYasseri

effect of live event strong.
influecne of friends ? significant effect for top artists.
