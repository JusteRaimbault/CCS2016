## Keynote - Stuart Kaufmann - Mind, Body and Quantum Mechanics

Back to Descartes. if brain classical physics, nothing for mind (causal closure). epiphenomenal mind. -> consciousness, but does not do anything.
for choice to be real, the present can have been different. : actualism of classical physics. ontology of choices.

Coherence in bio ? molecules staying 1000 times longer coherent than expected. Bird migration, superposition.
-> quantum bio.

von Neumann = detrministic evol of proba.

counterfactual ontological requirement for free will.
no mechanism for measurement. strong free-will theorem : there is no.

ex electron in one box : null measurement, Bomb experiment : counterfactual have real consequence.

Quantum mechanics : breaks causal closureof classical physics.

Poised Realm. Paused quantum system : decoherence is acausal, phase info lost at measurement : decoherence.
recoherence ? theoretical ground : Shor theorem.
light : light harvesting molecules.
slow decay of decoherence : power law.

order/criticality. fractal waves functions for organic molecules. half are quantum critical.
proteins are quantum critical.
critical proteins sometimes conducting.
Luca Turin's experiment.

Radin : from Mars to Earth : consciousness non local ? should exist a doable quantum experiment in next 50 years.

trans Turing system ? hybri classical/quantum computer.

Q : Carlos : about reductionism/emergence and complexity
-> causation.
possibility of counterfactuals to be true.

Q : Structure ?
Chalmers : no third party description of the world can play a role in consciousness.
mind about measurement ? then what carried measurement before ? fermions/bosons ? conscious also ? why not.

Q : consciousness serial. consciousness<->quantum : loose advantage of massive // of quantum computers?
measurement/real (?)
