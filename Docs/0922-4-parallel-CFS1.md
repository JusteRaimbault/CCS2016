### Bassolas - Collapse of public transport networks under stress

multilayer representation of public transport system.
use modelling : distribution of packets.

[Galloti, Barthelemy Sci Reports]

reconsideration of routes : adaptive routing protocol
*Q : link with assignement models ?*

OD from surveys (open data)

modal share as a function of distance.

variation of queues structures dpeending on routing protocoles.

lot of agents starting from a given place : response of nw ?
 routings :
   - shortest path
   - global knowledge
   - local knowledge (with memory)

(...)

penalize walking (function of time).

spatial distrib â‰  between local and global knowledge : different difficulty to route in the nw ?

Q : copying behavior ?
very important in disruptions.

Q : positioning traffic assignement fwk ?

Q : other types of nw ?


### talk

Q : clarify originality measures.
TYPO !
(rq : did not precise community detection algorithm)

### T Mizuno - Change of Human mobility network by a big incident

behavior and opinion changes by terrorist incidents.

use of geotagged tweets.

gridded data.

scaling of land prices against population.

estimation of population with tweets.
night-time population in national census data.
jawbone tracker dataset.

people movement : not rnadom walk.
distrib cos theta between successive movement vectors.

scaling law of human diffusion - scaling limit

no change in scaling after terror attacks.

mobility network : connexion between cells if someone moved. null model : random walk.

change in community structure before/after terror attacks.

cl : twitter bias correction possible
"cyber-physical" : relation tweet and area.

Q : bias correction of socio-eco profile ?


### F Battiston - Layered social influence promotes multiculturality

why are human inherently multicultural.
globalization : convergence ?
[Axelrod, 97] q traits and features.
imitation on some traits only. interaction proba proportionnal to cultural overlap.
stop conditions : full similarity or full diversity.

[Castellano, Marsili, Vespignani, 2000] transition from monocultural to multicultural
adding realistic feature (small world ; and drift) : multicultural
[Klemm et al., Physical Review E]

how to explain persistence (Axelrod not stable)

contribution : multi-layer relations, depend on each topic/domain (politics, religion, sport etc)
-> layered social influence model
frozen bonds possible

[., 2015]

phase diagram : larger region of multiculturality for layered.
under critical value : only multiculturality
with drift : states foudn by Axelrod are not stable.

with high density/low density layers : mixed regime accross layers.

[arxiv:1606.05641]

@fede7j

Q : what call multiculturality ?

Q : quantify threshold : weight layers ?

Q : timescales ? slow rate of interactions.
(counterintuitive results ?)

(q : // language evolution models ?)


### J Iacovacci - Emergence and charac of multi-layer communities in social collaboration networks.

[Bianconi, Darst, Iacovacci, Fortunato, PRE 2014] enforcing high density of triangles give communities in sparse nws.

Triadic closure model.
proba closing triangle.
link with clustering coefficient.

multi-layer nws : communities can span across layers and overlap.
[Battiston, Iacovacci, et al. PlosOne 2016] generalisation of triadic closure. p(layer) ; p(interlayer)

high clustering/strong overlap vs high clustering/weak overlap.

test on real datasets : APS and IMDB

network between layers : how patterns of collaboration span accross domains.

**Interesting for patents layer comparison ?**

Q : patterns of collab ?

Q : multplex/multilayer/def cult. : what insights from community detection ?
how pattern spread between layers.
