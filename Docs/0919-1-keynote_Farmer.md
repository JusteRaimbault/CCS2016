evolution of collective consciousness
climate change : feedback of our models.

becoming good at forecasting ?

DSGE : dynamics stochastic general eq // traffic models. - comes back into eq after shocks.

limits to prediction : very scarse datasets. -> ABM, using micro data.

[Galla and Farmer, PNAS 2013] : strategies at random, learning agents.
[Sander, Galla and Farmer, 2016] market generating its own endogeneous dynamics
[Pangallo, Sander, Galla and Farmer, 2016]

models out of eq requires more structure.

example ABM for finnancial risks :

[Aymanns and Farmer, 2015]

ABM for macro ?
 - calibrate model on micro data
challenges : estimate, initialization, modelling software ? -> OML !

towards economic simulation library.
