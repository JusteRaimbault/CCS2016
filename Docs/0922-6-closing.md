## Batty : Complexity and Cities. New science for a connected world.

### What is this science ?

not one but many.

science of behavior and space-economy.
flows and connectivity.
challenge : integration with other sciences.
NOT about smart cities

Used to be : Form fllows function. Sullivan, modern movement.

old model of city as machine to city as an organism.

evolution, emergence and path dependance : history matters.
not system closure but openness.

Abercrombie, Geddes, Darwin.
Geddes met Darwin.

[Cities in Evolution ; On growth and form, D'arcy Thompson] -> both together photo (UCL ?) !!!
[Batty, Marshall. Thinking organic, acting civic ...]
precursor bottom-up.
Sassen : "cities are complex but incomplete systems"
 => probably always be :: very â‰  from physics

### Aggregate Dynamics - Transitions

Population growth. // cities.
exponential !
singularity ?
[Foerster, Science 1960] 2026 singularity ? // AI singularity
stabilization ? all world is a city!
timescale : reaching tipping point ? before/after cities. No city/city
*phase transition ?*
top50 cities -> same curve.
rate of urbanisation : constant. by end of century, world entirely urbanized.
are there still cities ?
big cities ? (from small)
nature of urban/cities will change.
giant cities will be decreasing proportion? (already)
rank-size flattening in time.

still size distrib.

what happens when cities grow in size ?
agglo dis/economies : West Bettncourt, superlinear scaling.
how do measure city ? : boundary of a closed system ?
"big is beautiful" (Schumacher would turn in his grave!)

do not think of city as closed systems - not agree with SFI, Marshallians assumption that aggreg because big and buzz

### Form and function

sprawl of London.
Tree / dendrite ?
analogy with body ?

**IDEA : OSM simpl : launch/compare with very small res for data paper**

Alexander City is not a tree [anniv edition]
Jacobs

smart city and big data ? vis of traffic flows in time
heterogeneous big data.

scaling law for skyscrapper height

Krugman : rank size rule iron rule ? fails to define system appropriately !
what if add canada eg?
[More than a power law in Zipf]

percolation theory.
intraurban also.

### Tools and Techniques for Planning

our understanding is limited by scale and boundaries

what can and cannot be geenralized.

google ?

impact of crossrail on London.
but also on bigger area. -> wider than anticipated.
