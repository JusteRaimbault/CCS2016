## Jeff Johnson - Global Systems Science and Hypernetworks in Turbulent Times

Policy at all levels ; inerdisciplinary CSS ; policy informatics ; citizen engagment.

Macro <-> Meso <-> Micro
Information closure : don't need info from lower level.

Hypernetworks to represent multi-level systems.

hypernetwork : set of relational hypersimplices.

simplex -> vertex at upper level.

from Euler circles to multilevel triangles.

Narratives are multilevel systems. : ex Brexit. different narratives not compatible.

[Non-equilibrium social science, last chapter]

Policies <-> processes

Evidence-based policy citizen engagment <-> complex system science - policy informatics in the middle.


### Importance of education

provide accssible education -> Moocs etc.


Q : implementation of hypernetworks. ? -> policy informatics

Q : in France, 42 school : no degrees delivered. same for moocs, certificates. possibility of a parallel validation of content of studies, without going through academics ?
-> (? ...)

Q (info) : importance of a theory of narrative : -> important ofr policy elaboration. newspaper create narratives. they are embedded into reality of policies.


## C Bertelle - Reconstruct multi-level territory dynamics with Complex networks and self-organizing multi-agent systems

### Scope

Complex network morphodynamics : detection emerging structure ;study and control of evolution.

Applications : Territorial intelligence ; Logistics ; ad hoc nws (?)

Dynamical identification of graph clustering.
swarm movement

### Urban Risk Management

Le Havre : 33 seveso establishments.

Vulnerability analysis : multilevel analysis of the road nw.

Dynamical process over complex network to detect morphodynamical properties.
-> random walk gives Vulnerability in real time.

### Logistic corridors

Port-Urban interface : weakpoint of logistic chain.

Port attractivity analysis.

### Graphstream

graphstream tool.

Q : port attractivity : only economical, or ecological footprint ?

Q: indicators ?
multiscale rather than multilevel to have different geographical ranges.



## Pierre Collet - Personalized Open Education for the Masses

== POEM

Complex systems for teaching.

ant solving shortest path pbs : collective intelligence.
adaptive character ? -> find new routes. *resilience* ?
solved and understood mathematically.
100Mio years of evolution.

Apply to other fields ?
-> many non-curated items in universities that are "lost" for students if not easy accessible.

make student work on many pedagogical items : optimal path found as ants.

platform : collaborative open peer assessment.
can create content, communicate, follow path, etc.

curriculum for life-long education ; companies can pay and reditributed to other cpntributors.

Importance : non-curated content, self-organisation
already V1 used by 4 different univs, 1000 students.
V2 deployed in November : 120 universities

Rq Jeff : fantastic.
-> strong potential.

Q Rozenblatt : free courses, good ones, known by other. Here visualization of paths ?
phd in 2006 ; long experience. students find better paths than curriculum proposed by teachers.

[2007, P Collet et al. Adaptation of teh ACO Heuristics for Sequencing Learning Activities]

Rq Paul : cloud classrooms ?
emergence of new questions, etc. during the course.
synchronous method.
computers exploiting human interaction to find optimal path : people are doing the thinking ?

Q : role of forgetting ? forgetting here : evaporation of pheromones. erosion for passage and forgetting of individuals.


## Maria Gonzalez - Smart Cities: Ethical Issues investigated from CS perspective

Affordance (Gibson).

coevolution animal/environment.

Wiener : moral pbs with coordination human-machine.

Q : when smart cities ubiquitous ?
everywhere political polarisation.
ICT in polarisation.
principle of prudence.
Rq Paul. ethicals issues very important

not only negative


## Conclusion (C Rozenblatt )

Adaptability of social system.
New values.
Research directions ?

Paul : e-teams looking at weaknesses. (quick tbd (before Paris ?))

institutional support ? -> meeting in Paris. Numeric universities FR/Europe.

Paul : one digital univ in each country where well implanted. good topic to launch e-univ. Open Roadmapping at any territorial level.

Session with interaction with all over the world. -> e-confs.
(physical pres. important -> cl )
