# Satelite : Non-stationarity and ergodicity


## Farmer - Reality Game

People influencing outcomes : people changing real world == reflexivity.

[Journal of Eco Dynamics and Control, Farmer, Lloyd, ?]

self-adaptive strategy - reality map.
convergence of bias to 0.5 : one guy finishes with everything.

path-dependancy : weak self-fulfilling property.

Over-self-fulfilling : 0 and 1 fixed points.

Nash eq ?

if big, need to take into account that change market -> long-range couplings.

weakly non ergodic system : converges towards random var
